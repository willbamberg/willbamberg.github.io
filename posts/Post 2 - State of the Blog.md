#State of the Blog

Or "What Am I Even Doing"

I began this blog on what amounts to a whim and a really good mood. In this, my second post, I'd like to generally outline my motivations for this blog, where I want it to go, etc.

##Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog late at night, with the momentum I had going from my excitement about wanting to travel. I initially wasn't even intending to create it, I was just in a great mood at 1 am and wanted to write out my thoughts and put into words my excitement for the future. Before I knew it however, I'd written a page.

I've long liked the idea of blogging. I enjoy writing about and sharing my thoughts/opinions, and the few times I've done so on Facebook I've had positive experiences. Until now though, I never seriously considered the idea. I'm pretty busy in general, and I haven't been confident that I'd be able to stick to it for long (or inspired enough to ignore that worry). But, when I realized that I'd written what basically amounted to a full blog post, I decided I might as well just go through with it. And the rest is history. Or it's last 8 days. 

##What The Blog Looks Like Now

Right now, this blog has a temporary title and is hosted on Blogger with the first stock theme I found. It was ~3 am when I finished my first post and I just wanted to post it (before I lost the nerve) and go to sleep. I decided that the finer details could wait (though I certainly planned to spend a great deal of time choosing the name, theme, font, format, etc.).

I still don't have a real title. To be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time coming up with ideas because I've been out of town. I've also been putting it off since I tend to be both super bad at coming up with names for things and super particular (a less than ideal combination), so it might be a while. I'll figure it out. 

In exciting news, my blog will only be hosted on Blogger for a short while longer! When my friend Rushi saw my first post, he immediately offered to help me host it independently via Github and Heckle (his self-built static site generator/blog engine). This will allow me ultimate customizability and cool factor/uniqueness, as well as knocking out the blog hosting middleman, so to speak. It also has the added benefit of pushing me further into the programming realm. I'll likely finish getting that set up during the week after spring break. 
Huge thanks to Rushi for his help and enthusiasm!


##Where I Want This Blog To Go/Why I Still Want This Blog To Exist

As I wrote above, this blog began because of an late-night whim. I've spent a lot of time in the week since then thinking about why I want to continue with it (beyond just that initial impulse). I want this blog to be a positive motivator for me to procrastinate less, be more productive, and act upon the things that matter to me. I hope that continuing to write about my goals, thoughts, life in general, etc. will give me positive momentum and clarity that I can translate into the rest of my life.

I don't really have a set goal in mind for how often I'll post. I could see setting a goal of once a week, but I know that once school starts back up and I get busy I won't feel like I have enough time. Maybe once every two weeks is enough. We'll see, I guess. I'm not setting a hard limit for myself now, though I'll shoot for a post every week or two. As for content, thus far I'm just going to write about whatever strikes my fancy (although I'd welcome suggestions!). The next post I'll make will probably be about my recent ski trip. 

Have a good spring break everyone!
